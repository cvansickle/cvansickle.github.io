## Read Me

### Site: cvansickle.github.io
This is the read me file for Caroline VanSickle's academic webpage.

Instructions:
- Use markdown
- Edit files in Atom locally
- When happy with something, use the Git tab in Atom to
  (1) stage the changed files
  (2) compose a commit message that answers "This commit will..."
  (3) push the commit to github (use the up arrow in the bottom task bar).
